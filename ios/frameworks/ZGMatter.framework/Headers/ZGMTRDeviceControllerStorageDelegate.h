/**
 * Protocol for storing and retrieving controller-specific data.
 *
 * Implementations of this protocol MUST keep these things in mind:
 *
 * 1) The controller provided to the delegate methods may not be fully
 *    initialized when the callbacks are called.  The only safe thing to do with
 *    it is to get its controllerID.
 *
 * 2) The delegate method calls will happen on the queue that was provided along
 *    with the delegate.  All Matter work will be blocked until the method
 *    completes, and these calls may themselves block other Matter API calls
 *    from completing.  Attempting to call any Matter API on the queue used for
 *    this delegate, apart from de-serializing and serializing the items being
 *    stored and calling ZGMTRDeviceControllerStorageClasses(), is likely to lead
 *    to deadlocks.
 *
 * 3) Security level and sharing type will always be the same for any given key value
 *    and are provided to describe the data should the storage delegate choose to
 *    implement separating storage location by security level and sharing type.
