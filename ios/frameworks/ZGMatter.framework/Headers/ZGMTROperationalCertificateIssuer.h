/**
 * A way for ZGMTROperationalCertificateIssuer to control whether it wants the

 * anchors.  If this returns NO, then productAttestationAuthorityCertificates
 * should be passed in via ZGMTRDeviceControllerFactoryParams, as well as any
 * desired additional certificationDeclarationCertificates.
 *
 * If this returns YES, then all device attestation checks that require some
 * sort of trust anchors are delegated to this ZGMTROperationalCertificateIssuer,
 * which can use the arguments passed to
 * issueOperationalCertificateForRequest:attestationInfo:controller:completion:
 * to perform the checks.
 *
 * Specifically, the following device attestation checks are not performed and
 * must be done by the ZGMTROperationalCertificateIssuer:
 *
 * (1) Make sure the PAA is valid and approved by CSA.
 * (2) VID-scoped PAA check: if the PAA is VID scoped, then its VID must match the DAC VID.
 * (3) cert chain check: verify PAI is signed by PAA, and DAC is signed by PAI.
 * (4) PAA subject key id extraction: the PAA subject key must match the PAA key referenced in the PAI.
 * (5) CD signature check: make sure a valid CSA CD key is used to sign the CD.
 *
 * This will be read on an arbitrary queue and must not block or call any
 * Matter APIs.
